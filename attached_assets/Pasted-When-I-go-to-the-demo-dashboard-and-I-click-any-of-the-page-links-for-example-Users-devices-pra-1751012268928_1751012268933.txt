The document should cover all the following stages clearly: development, staging/QA, UAT, and production deployment. It must also explain how to connect the app to real-time data services and how to prepare the app for client testing and access.
Make sure the process includes: tools needed, environment variables, database setup, testing steps, CI/CD integration (preferably GitHub Actions), and platform-specific deployment (e.g., Firebase, Vercel, App Store, etc.)."

"In addition, generate the following supporting files and assets:

A formatted deployment document (Word & PDF)

Example .env.staging and .env.production files

A scaffolded folder structure for a typical full-stack or mobile app project

A CI/CD pipeline config using GitHub Actions for deployment to staging and production

Two separate setup instructions — one for Intel MacBook and one for MacBook M2/M3 architectures, including all relevant terminal commands, Node.js setup, and emulators (e.g., for Firebase, MongoDB)._
